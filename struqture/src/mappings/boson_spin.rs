//! Jordan-Wigner mapping between fermionic operators and spin operators.

//! The convention used is to treat the qubit state $|0 \rangle$ as empty, and the state $|1\rangle$
//! as occupied by a fermion. The corresponding mapping is given by

//! JW(a_p^{dagger}) = ( \prod_{i = 1}^{p - 1} Z_i )(X_p - i Y_p)*1/2
//! JW(a_p) = ( \prod_{i = 1}^{p - 1} Z_i )(X_p + i Y_p)*1/2
