# Container Types

This part of the user documentation focuses on the shared patterns between all physical types: spins, fermions, bosons and mixed systems.
All container types for operators, Hamiltonians and open systems behave like hash maps or dictionaries with products of fundamental quantum operators as keys.

The following container types are available, regardless of physical type:
- [indices](./indices.md)
- [operators](./operators_hamiltonians.md)
- [Hamiltonians](./operators_hamiltonians.md)
- [noise operators](./noise_operators.md)
- [open systems](./open_systems.md)
