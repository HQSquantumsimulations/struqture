# Container Types

This part of the user documentation focuses on the shared patterns between all physcial types: spins, fermions, bosons and mixed systems.
All container types for operators, Hamiltonians and open systems behave like hash maps or dictionaries with product of fundamental quantum operators as keys.
For a discussion of the keys see the [indices](./indices.md) section. For a discussion of the 

The following container types are available, regardless of physical type:
- [indices](./indices.md)
- [operators](./operators_hamiltonians_and_systems.md)
- [hamiltonians](./operators_hamiltonians_and_systems.md)
- [systems](./operators_hamiltonians_and_systems.md)
- [hamiltonian systems](./operators_hamiltonians_and_systems.md)
- [noise operators](./noise_operators_and_systems.md)
- [noise systems](./noise_operators_and_systems.md)
- [open systems](./open_systems.md)
