# Non-spin objects

Struqture also supports non-spin systems. The following object families are currently available:

* [bosonic modes](./bosons/intro.md)
* [fermionic modes](./fermions/intro.md)
* [mixed systems](./mixed_systems/intro.md): these classes allow combinations of spins, bosonic modes, and fermionic modes within a single model.

As with spin objects, these types can be instantiated programmatically or loaded from a file, and once constructed they can be used in the same manner as user-created objects. Refer to the respective sections for details on available constructors, operators, getters, setters, and properties.
