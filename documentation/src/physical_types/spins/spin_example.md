# Applied Examples

Struqture can be used in a variety of contexts, some of which are detailed below. 

## NMR

### HQS NMR

Struqture can be used in conjunction with the HQS NMR package, to calculate NMR correlators for Hamiltonians. This is shown in the following examples: 

* [Simulate a small-scale Hamiltonian from struqture (json) on a quantum computer](https://github.com/HQSquantumsimulations/hqstage-examples/blob/main/hqs_spectrum_tools/10_nmr_using_struqture_and_qiskit.ipynb)
* [Simulate an NMR spectrum from a struqture Hamiltonian](https://github.com/HQSquantumsimulations/hqstage-examples/blob/main/hqs_spectrum_tools/7_spectrum_from_struqture_hamiltonian.ipynb)
* [Solving spin lattice models using struqture](https://github.com/HQSquantumsimulations/hqstage-examples/blob/main/hqs_spectrum_tools/8_spin_lattice_models.ipynb)

Please note that the notebooks linked above are pre-run, as they require the HQS NMR python package. Should you wish to run them yourself, please install the HQS NMR package using the [install instructions](https://docs.cloud.quantumsimulations.de/installation.html) and download the accompanying HQS NMR examples.
