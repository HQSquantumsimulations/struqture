# Applied Examples

Struqture can be used in a variety of contexts, some of which are detailed below. 

## NMR

### HQS NMR

Struqture can be used in conjunction with the HQS NMR package, to calculate NMR correlators for Hamiltonians. This is shown in the following examples: 

* [Simulate a small-scale Hamiltonian from struqture (json)](10_nmr_using_struqture_and_qiskit.ipynb)
* [Simulate an NMR spectrum from a struqture Hamiltonian](https://github.com/HQSquantumsimulations/hqstage-examples/blob/main/hqs_spectrum_tools/7_spectrum_from_struqture_hamiltonian.ipynb)
* [Solving spin lattice models using struqture](https://github.com/HQSquantumsimulations/hqstage-examples/blob/main/hqs_spectrum_tools/8_spin_lattice_models.ipynb)

Please note that in order to run them you will need the HQS NMR package. You can find install instructions for it [here](https://docs.cloud.quantumsimulations.de/installation.html).
