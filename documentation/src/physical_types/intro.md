# Physical Types

In this part of the user documentation we show the basic usage of operators, Hamiltonians and open systems for spins, bosons, fermions and mixed systems.
Stuqture is designed to use the same patterns to construct objecs across all physical types. There is a large overlap in the user documentation between all physical types.
