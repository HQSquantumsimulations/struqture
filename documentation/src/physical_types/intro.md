# How to use struqture objects

<!-- TODO: re-write with the following focus: (1) this docu shows how to build your own objects, but if you have a struqture file, please do this (2) -->

In this part of the user documentation we show how to work with a user-selected pre-defined Hamiltonian from our database, e.g. [nmr_database](https://docs.cloud.quantumsimulations.de/hqs-spectrum-tools/subfolder/components/molecule_input/molecular_data.html).

<!-- have an example that uses the database and prints out the result + uses getters -> read the rest of the documentation
Discuss the serialisation here -->
